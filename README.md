# 🚀 KABoom: Kubernetes Attribute-Based Optimization of Cloud Bursting

KABoom is a project that leverages Kubernetes and an attribute-based approach to optimize the process of cloud bursting, ensuring efficient resource management and enhanced security in cloud environments. This project is based on [onehundreten](https://github.com/MRColorR/onehundredten)` by @MRColorR  and [abe-webapp](https://github.com/martinapalmucci/abe-webapp) by @martinapalmucci .

## 🌐 Overview

KABoom is designed to enhance the capabilities of modern distributed systems. It focuses on optimizing cloud bursting, a process that allows private cloud services to 'burst' into the public cloud when local resources are exhausted. The project addresses the configuration issues related to load management between the private and public clouds.

## 📚 Key Concepts

- **Cloud Bursting**: ☁️➡️☁️ This is a model that allows private cloud services to 'burst' into the public cloud when local resources are exhausted.
- **Attribute-Based Management**: 🏷️ This approach is used to simplify the process of load distribution and resource allocation between private and public clouds during cloud bursting operations.
- **Kubernetes**: 🐳 An open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The main objectives of KABoom are:

1. To develop a systematic approach that ensures semantic meaning is associated with the generic Kubernetes label concept.
2. To address the security aspects of cloud bursting.
3. To provide an architectural solution to enable a more integrated and effective deployment security solution for cloud bursting based on the Kubernetes orchestration.

## 🚀 Getting Started
